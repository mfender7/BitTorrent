Instructions:
Open project in Eclipse.
Eclipse might complain about not having the proper jars. You may have to manually add the jar files to your own build path. 
They're located in BitTorrent/jar.
Run App.java.
A pdf should be created in your project root directory. 
If the pdf says it is damaged, try running again.
