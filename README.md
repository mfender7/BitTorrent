BitTorrent
==========
Project for class! We have our Apache license, so please don't sue us!

We've used the ttorrent library from here: 
https://github.com/mpetazzoni/ttorrent

Instructions:
Eclipse might complain about not having the proper jars.
Go to ttorrent/jar. The three jar files are there. Adding them as a local jar never worked, so I added them as an external jar. Hopefully this fixes most issues.
