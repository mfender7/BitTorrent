BitTorrent
==========
Project for class! We have our Apache license, so please don't sue us!

We've used the ttorrent library from here: 
https://github.com/mpetazzoni/ttorrent

And the Apache Http library!
http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-core-ga/index.html

Instructions:
Eclipse might complain about not having the proper jars. Or since I'm not checking in project files, you have to manually add the jar files to your own build path. They're located in BitTorrent/jar.
